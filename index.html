				<h2> ABOUT THE OWNER </h2>
				<p> Ghearrina Lorem Fajardo grew up in San Fernando City, La Union suburb,
					surrounded by dazzling outfits and pile of makeups. At the age of 7, she
					already knows how to work with beauty products and chooses her own OOTDs.
					She loves the aroma of coffee with 2 teaspoons of creamer and a ginormous
					amount of sugar. She is now 16 years old, an incoming Grade 11 in the next
					school year. She is also known to be a flexible dancer and a dreamy singer.
					She is one of the choir of angels of God, serving at the Cathedral of Saint
					William the Hermit Parish. She believes in the saying that "Beauty is in the
					eye of the beholder."</p>
